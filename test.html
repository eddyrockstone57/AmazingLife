<h1>The Amazing Life of Edwin Konadu</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p1>Hi, my name is Edwin Konadu and I am currently a senior at Rutgers Univeristy Newark. I am a Computer Science major and mathematics minor. I was born and raised in West Africa, Ghana I moved to America at a very soon age.
I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. 
It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, itâ€™s great and I am all different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. 
I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person. 
I understand and know that we all put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot stand.</p1>
<br>Academically I am a student who likes to be mentally challenged and I enjoy both hands on projects as well as conventional learning.
In compare to studies, I am good at sports. so I was the captain of my high school soccer team. I was the best soccer player at my high school. Besides this, I am a fast runner also and I love athletics. 
One sport I wish I knew how to do better is swimming, I really wish I knew how to swim because I cannot swim to safe my life.
